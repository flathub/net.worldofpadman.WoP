  <description>
    <p>
      The earliest PadMaps for Quake 3 Arena gave rise to the mod PadWorld, which was followed by the colorful evolution, World of PADMAN. Developed by 
      cartoonist and illustrator ENTE, PadWorld Entertainment presents a colorful, freeware, fun shooter for the young and the young at heart, powered 
      by an enhanced id Tech 3 graphics engine.

      WoP is the domain of ENTE's comic strip superhero PADMAN and his motley crew. Their mission is to make your gaming experience seriously addictively 
      fun, no matter your skill level or character role you jump into. Over the years, the maps have been revamped, the bots improved, the KillerDucks have 
      been kept hungry, and the weapons have been re-polished. In all, there are 24 maps. Each supports up to nine game types, including WoP's unique Spray 
      Your Color, Last Pad Standing, Big Balloon, Catch The KillerDuck, Freeze Tag, and, of course, Capture the Lolly. Explore scaled-up, richly detailed 
      environments of everyday places where imaginative characters go berserk with colorful plastic weaponry and power-ups. Start rockin' to the Dieselkopf 
      and Neurological soundtracks, and listen to the Pad Anthem performed by Green Sun. Grab your earphones!
